/**
 * TileCacheDelay is like TileCache but gets (mostly) rid of the effect that the tiles are drawn one-by-one by delaying
 * the tiles. This class is just a cosmetic improvement - it doesn't intent to improve performance.
 *
 * This is done by trying to load a whole square instead of just a single tile. The exact algorithm is as follows:
 *
 * Everytime the robot enters a new center tile, request() is called. This functions stores the requested
 * detail::ExpiringArea, where a ExpiringArea is just an Area at a tile id with a timeout. Therefore we will collect a
 * history of Areas (detail::AreaHistory) while the robot moves.
 *
 * A tile will be drawn if it's ready(). A tile is ready() iff:
 * * it's successfully loaded from the file system or the internet, and
 * * either of the following things happened:
 *   * the tile is inside an Area which has all its tiles successfully loaded, or
 *   * the tile is inside an Area which expired, i.e. the Area was requested some seconds ago but not all tiles are
 * loaded.
 *
 * @warning Since TileCache isn't a virtual class, you shouldn't upcast a TileCacheDelay object to a TileCache object!
