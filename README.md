**GLIO: Tightly-Coupled GNSS/LiDAR/IMU Integration for Continuous and Drift-free State Estimation of Intelligent Vehicles in Urban Areas.** [paper link](./support_files/GLIO_paper.pdf)

**GLIO** is an accurate and robust online GNSS/LiDAR/IMU odometry system that tightly fuses the raw measurements from GNSS (pseudorange and Doppler), LiDAR, and IMU through non-linear factor graph optimization (FGO), which enables globally continuous and drift-free pose estimation even in highly challenging environments like urban canyons. 

The package is based on C++ which is compatible with the robot operation system (ROS) platform. Meanwhile, this package combines the RTKLIB (**[version: 2.4.3 b33](http://www.rtklib.com/)**) to read/decode the GNSS [RINEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RINEX) files. Users from the Robotics field can easily have access to GNSS raw data for further study.

## System pipeline

</p>

We propose a system that utilizes two stages of the optimization to achieve global consistent and continuous pose estimation in real-time.
  - In the first stage of optimization-the *optimizeSlidingWindow* stage, the sliding-window-based FGO is employed to integrate the GNSS-related factors, IMU pre-integration factor, and scan-to-map-based LiDAR factor for efficient odometry estimation.
  - In the second stage of optimization-the *optimizeBatch* stage, the LiDAR factor is employed as a scan-to-multiscan scheme to maintain global consistency and improve the robustness to the GNSS outlier by large-scale batch optimization.

    <img src="./support_files/lc_tc_comparison.png" alt="drawing" width="800"/>
</p>

In this package, different fusion strategies for GNSS/LIO integration are implemented for comparison and further development, including
- The pose graph-based loosely-coupled GNSS/LIO integration
- The tightly-coupled GNSS/LIO integration with relative pose constraints
- The tightly-coupled GNSS/LiDAR/IMU integration with scan-to-multiscan LiDAR feature constraints.

The trajectories of different fusion methods are shown as figure below.

To enable and visualize different fusion results, following parameters need to be noted.

- ```visualization/LCinLocal```: Set true for activation and visualization of loosely-coupled GNSS/LIO fusion in ENU frame.
- ```Estimator/enable_batch_fusion```: Set true for activation and visualization of tightly-coupled batch-based GNSS/LiDAR/IMU integration in ENU frame.
- ```Estimator/sms_fusion_level```: Types of scan-to-multiscan constraints in batch-based integration. Set 0 for relative pose constraints, 1 for LiDAR surf feature constraints.

### 1.4. **Extra Libraries**
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-novatel-msgs
```
### 1.5. **Pre-built Libraries**
[GraphGNSSLib V1.1](https://github.com/weisongwen/GraphGNSSLib.git) and [gnss_comm](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/gnss_comm.git) is pre-built in the package.

## 2. **Build GLIO**
Clone the repository and catkin_make:
```bash
mkdir GLIO_ws/src
cd ~/GLIO_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/XikunLiu-huskit/GLIO.git
cd ../
# if you fail in the last catkin_make, please source and catkin_make again
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
## 3. **Run GLIO with dataset *UrbanNav***
Launch GLIO via:
```
roslaunch GLIO run_urban_hk.launch
```
Wait for GNSS data preprocessing, when the GNSS trajectory appears, play the bag:
```
rosbag play UrbanNav-HK_Whampoa-20210521_sensors.bag
```
Visit [UrbanNav](https://www.polyu-ipn-lab.com/download) and download more data sequences follow the [instruction](https://github.com/IPNL-POLYU/UrbanNavDataset/blob/master/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).
